## What is the project about?
<p>The "Guess The Number" project is a a console-based Java implementation. </p>


<p>The idea of this project is to a guess a random number generated by the computer and it consists of three levels.
    You have to guess in the range from 1 to 100 (level 1), from 2 to 200 (level 2) and from 3 to 300 (level 3). You win
    the game when you complete all the levels. If you happen to be struggling, there are two hints in each level you can
    use if you would like to.</p>
